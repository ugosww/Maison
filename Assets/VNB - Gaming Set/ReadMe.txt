.-------------------.

The aim for this package is to help set-up things quickly by providing ready-to-use prefabs of everything:

- Materials and original palette (you can always modify or expand them).
(if you're using URP, then you will need to convert these to URP, this is done with just one click from within Unity)
- Prefabs of models ready to place in scene, ready to be animated or manipulated from script (some are ready-to-use compositions of other models).

*Make sure to snap things to the grid when using tiles*

*Look at my itch.io page for details*

--- Description ---

I've included some low poly desktop PCs, retro and modern consoles directly based off real counterparts, gaming chairs with different variantions in a modular way, furniture, TVs/Monitors as well as some streaming related furniture, lighting and deco furniture. Original textures included (for each type of game disk/cartridge, deco, etc) as well as some starting palettes.

--- Supportive Edition [2$+] ---

[Supportive Edition available at 2$+, donate and enjoy 25 extra models featuring 4 extra retro consoles and 4 new modern PCs]
